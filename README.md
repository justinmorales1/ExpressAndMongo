# Getting Started with Create React App
This project is just a simple express server that connects to a mongoDb.
It has some simple routes to get and update collections in mongo.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

By running npm run dev you are using nodemon so you do not need
to stop and re start your express server every time you make a change
it will automatically do it for you.
